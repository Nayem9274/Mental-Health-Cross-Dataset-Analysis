# Mental health across contexts: a cross-dataset study covering medical students, quarantined individuals, and psychiatric disordered subjects

 Mental health research has traditionally focused on isolated contexts, such as medical
 education, quarantine, or clinical settings, without examining how demographic factors such
 as age, gender, and education influence mental health across different populations and
 settings. This lack of cross-context comparison limits our understanding of how demographic
 and situational factors interact to shape mental health outcomes. To address this gap, we
 conduct a comparative cross-dataset analysis using three distinct datasets—medical stu
dents, quarantined individuals, and psychiatric disordered subjects—analyzing them sepa
rately before drawing cross-context comparisons. Through statistical and network-based
 analyses, we explore how demographic factors shape mental health outcomes in these varied
 contexts. While isolated analyses reveal important patterns—such as women experiencing
 heightened stress during quarantine and medical students displaying increased empathy—
 our comparative approach uncovers novel insights. For instance, the impact of age on mental
 health differs significantly between quarantine and clinical settings. Additionally, while higher
 education is generally linked to better mental health, this association does not hold for
 medical students. These findings highlight the value of cross-dataset analysis in providing
 richer insights into how external factors impact mental health across diverse contexts,
 offering valuable guidance for future research and interventions.
